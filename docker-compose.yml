    # Network mode host might be needed for OSC if running on same machine as X32 or for correct UDP routing,
    # but for pure MQTT/Logic, bridge is fine.
    # However, if Brain sends OSC directly (Task 3), it needs network access.
    # If Brain sends OSC via Edge Node (Task 2), then Brain only needs MQTT.
    # Architecture says Brain talks MQTT to Edge, Edge talks OSC to X32.
    # So bridge network is fine.
